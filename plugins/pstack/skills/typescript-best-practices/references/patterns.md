# TypeScript patterns

Code examples for each rule in `SKILL.md`. The underlying principles are language-agnostic. See the **principle-type-system-discipline** and **principle-boundary-discipline** skills.

## Branded types

Brand primitives so they can't be mixed up. Validate once at the boundary. Downstream code trusts the type.

Match the `readonly __brand: "X"` shape. Don't invent a new convention.

```ts
type AgentId = string & { readonly __brand: "AgentId" };
```

A brand with no validation behind it is a cast with a nicer name.

## Discriminated unions

Model variants with a literal discriminant. Every variant shares the field name and each variant's value is unique, so impossible combos can't be represented.

```ts
// Don't. Boolean + optionals lets contradictory states exist.
type DiffState = { loading: boolean; diff?: GitDiff; error?: string };

// Do. Only valid states exist.
type DiffState =
  | { kind: "loading" }
  | { kind: "ready"; diff: GitDiff }
  | { kind: "error"; error: string };
```

When the union crosses a boundary, define it as a schema so the type, the validator, and the wire codec are one definition. Pick one discriminant name per codebase and stick to it.

## Constructive modeling

Build the type from parts that are all legal instead of restricting a loose type with runtime checks.

Non-empty, via a variadic tuple:

```ts
type NonEmpty<T> = readonly [T, ...T[]];

// Don't: T[] plus a length check every caller must repeat
function leader(entries: string[]): string {
  if (entries.length === 0) throw new Error("no entries");
  return entries[0];
}

// Do: an empty value of the type can't exist
function leader(entries: NonEmpty<string>): string {
  return entries[0];
}
```

Where a plain `T[]` arrives, narrow once with a guard. The fact then travels in the type:

```ts
const isNonEmpty = <T>(xs: readonly T[]): xs is NonEmpty<T> => xs.length > 0;

if (isNonEmpty(entries)) {
  leader(entries);
}
```

Even length, as pairs:

```ts
type Pairs<T> = [T, T][];
```

A time range, as start plus duration:

```ts
// Don't: a comment holds the invariant
type TimeRange = { start: Date; end: Date }; // start <= end

// Do: a negative range can't be written; derive end when needed
type TimeRange = { start: Date; durationMs: number };
```

Keep `durationMs` a plain number. Brand it (per Branded types) only if a raw number could be passed where a duration is expected, not by reflex. Pick the representation that makes the bad state unconstructable, then expose the reading you need on top (`pairs.flat()`, a `rangeEnd()` helper).

## Simplest total type

Don't strengthen everything. Keep `T[]` when every operation on it is total:

```ts
const sum = (xs: number[]) => xs.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // [] is 0, fine
```

Strengthen when the loose type forces a lie at a use site. The tells are `!`, `arr[0] as T`, and a "should never happen" throw:

```ts
// Don't: partiality smuggled past the compiler
function newestSession(sessions: Session[]): Session {
  return sessions.at(0)!;
}

// Do: strengthen the input; the assertion disappears
function newestSession(sessions: NonEmpty<Session>): Session {
  return sessions[0];
}
```

Weakening the result to `Session | undefined` is the other total signature.

## `unknown` over `any`

External data is always `unknown`. Narrow before use.

```ts
// Don't
function handle(input: any) {
  return input.foo.bar;
}

// Do
function handle(input: unknown) {
  if (typeof input === "object" && input !== null && "foo" in input) {
    // narrowed; compiler verifies access
  }
}
```

External sources include RPC payloads, `JSON.parse`, `postMessage`, IPC, file contents, environment variables, database results.

## Schemas before hand-rolled guards

Before writing a property-by-property type guard for external data, look for the repository's runtime schema library and existing schemas. Let one schema own validation and derive the TypeScript type from it with that library's inference helper. Do not maintain a schema, a duplicate interface, and a guard that can drift apart. Do not add a new schema dependency for one guard. This rule prefers the schema system the codebase already trusts.

## No `as` casts

Every `as` is a potential runtime crash. Cast only after the type system has verified the claim.

```ts
// Don't
const user = data as User;

// Don't
function isUser(data: unknown): data is User {
  return typeof data === "object" && data !== null && "id" in data;
}
```

Parse with the schema that owns the shape instead. When you need a guard, derive it from that schema so it checks exactly what the schema checks.

When refactoring an `as` out of existing code, identify why TypeScript can't infer:

- Missing discriminant: add one, switch to a discriminated union.
- Overly wide source type (e.g. `Record<string, unknown>`): narrow it.
- Untyped boundary: parse with the schema that owns the shape. Add a schema only where none exists.
- Genuinely inexpressible: use a branded type or `satisfies`.

## Narrowing hierarchy

From best to last-resort:

1. **Discriminated union switch / if.** Compiler narrows automatically.
2. **`in` operator.** `"key" in obj` narrows to variants containing that key.
3. **`typeof` / `instanceof`.** For primitives and class instances.
4. **User-defined type guard.** When the above aren't enough.
5. **`as` cast.** Only after validation.

```ts
function area(s: Shape): number {
  if ("radius" in s) return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2; // narrowed to circle
  return s.width * s.height; // narrowed to rect
}
```

## Type guards

A guard must actually verify the claim. A lying guard is worse than `as`.

```ts
function isCircle(s: Shape): s is Shape & { kind: "circle" } {
  return s.kind === "circle";
}
```

Prefer discriminant narrowing when possible. When the shape has a schema, derive the guard from it.

## Exhaustiveness

In default arms, assign the discriminant to a `never`-typed local.

```ts
// Value-returning switch
function area(s: Shape): number {
  switch (s.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * s.radius ** 2;
    case "rect":
      return s.width * s.height;
    default: {
      const _exhaustive: never = s;
      return _exhaustive;
    }
  }
}

// Void switch
function handle(s: Shape): void {
  switch (s.kind) {
    case "circle":
      drawCircle(s);
      break;
    case "rect":
      drawRect(s);
      break;
    default: {
      const _exhaustive: never = s;
      void _exhaustive;
    }
  }
}
```

Return-style in value-returning switches, void-style in statement switches.

## `satisfies` over `as`

`satisfies` validates without widening literal types.

```ts
// Don't. Widens, loses literal types.
const config = { theme: "dark", cols: 3 } as Config;

// Do. Validates AND preserves literal types.
const config = { theme: "dark", cols: 3 } satisfies Config;
// config.theme is "dark" (literal), not string
```

## Boundary validation

Validate once where data crosses in. Trust types inside. See the **principle-boundary-discipline** skill.

- **Wire formats** (proto, JSON-RPC): parse with `ignoreUnknownFields` so forward-compatible changes don't break old clients.
- **Persisted JSON:** a versioned schema, with the failure mapped to an error the caller can handle.
- **Don't re-validate** deep in call chains.

## Time and randomness

Read time and randomness from the environment so tests can control them. Keep the logic that uses the value pure.

```ts
// Don't
const isExpired = (token: Token) => Date.now() >= token.expiresAt;

// Do
const isExpired = (token: Token, now: number) => now >= token.expiresAt;
```

## Schema-derived types

When a `.proto`, OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, database migration, or runtime schema already defines a shape, derive from it instead of duplicating it.

```ts
// Don't. Duplicate shape, drifts when the schema changes.
type CheckSummary = {
  totalCount: number;
  checks: { name: string; status: string }[];
};
function renderChecks(s: CheckSummary) {
  /* ... */
}

// Do. Derive from the generated schema type.
import type { ChecksMessage } from "<generated module>";
function renderChecks(s: Pick<ChecksMessage, "totalCount" | "checks">) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Reach for `Pick`, `Omit`, `Parameters`, `ReturnType`, `Awaited`, `typeof` before writing a new interface.

## Object args

```ts
// Don't. Swap two args, still compiles.
openFile(uri, {
  startLineNumber: 10,
  startColumn: 1,
  endLineNumber: 10,
  endColumn: 1,
});

// Do. Order-independent, self-documenting.
openFile({
  uri,
  selection: {
    startLineNumber: 10,
    startColumn: 1,
    endLineNumber: 10,
    endColumn: 1,
  },
});
```

Skip on hot paths: per-frame render, tokenizers, parsers, anything in a tight loop where the allocation cost matters.
